Version 0.4 - Coming Soon
  * Better parallelization for small cutoff frequencies
  * Asynchronous host memory access

Version 0.3.5 - February 25, 2008 -  Performance Improvements, Renaming
  * More efficient memory access (better coalescing, better shared memory usage)
  * More optimal thread block sizes
  * Block size can be controlled at run time.
  * Throughout the library the word "interpolant" has been replaced with "data" and "fvr" with "vis".
  * Added support for the special case of no argument scaling
  * Added support for the Gaussian

Version 0.3 - June 22, 2007
  * The previous versions computed the projection incorrectly, this has been fixed.
  * The library has been significantly optimized (observed running 6x faster): using shared memory, 32-bit fast math functions, and a complex-to-real Fourier transform.
  * The interactive application has been redone using wxWidgets.
  * There is a Python script for generating CUDA kernels for new functions.

Version 0.2 - April 25, 2007
  * The interactive application is working
  * This is a source code only release (I'll provide binaries for major releases)

Version 0.1 - April 22, 2007
  * The entire library has only been tested when using CUDA emulation
  * The interactive application is untested
  * The next version will be released once I get a 8600 and CUDA support is released for it.
